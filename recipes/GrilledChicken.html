        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>However many chicken breast you plan to cook</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Garlic powder</li>
            <li>Any other seasonings you would like to add</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash chicken and place on a paper towl to dry</li>
            <li>Pat dry with more paper towl. The trick to delicious chicken breast is to cook it without moisture on the outside.</li>
            <li>Place chicken on a cutting board. If some pieces are too thick (over an inch thick) fillet them in half</li>
            <li>Heat your pan on the stove to medium to medium-low heat. My dorm stove isn't very hot so I put it on medium.</li>
            <li>Season chicken with all of your seasonings. First add salt, then the rest of your seasonings. Completely cover the chicken until it is a different color</li>
            <li>Before placing your chicken on the stove, spray your pan with vegetable oil. We do this now so the oil doesn't burn.</li>
            <li>Pat dry your chicken one last time since the salt will bring more moisture out of the chciken, and place your chicken on the pan.</li>
            <li>Try to leave the chicken alone until one side has a nice crust on it. Then flip one time. When they both have a crust, your chicken is ready!</li>
        </ol>
